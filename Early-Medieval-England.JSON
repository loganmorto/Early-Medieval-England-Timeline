Events, writings, and archaeological evidence suggest the timeline is more nuanced. By the mid-5th century, there was significant Anglo-Saxon influence in the region. The terms 'Saxons', 'Anglo-Saxons', and 'English' often overlapped, referencing the Germanic invaders.",

            "text": "This century marked a period of ambiguity in Anglo-Saxon England. Gildas provides an account from the mid-6th century, hinting at British struggles against the Saxons and the battle of mons Badonicus. The narrative, however, remains uncertain. King Arthur, an iconic figure from this era, is surrounded by legends, and his historical accuracy is debated. This century is foundational, but specifics are hard to pin down due to the mixture of myth, legend, and real events.",
